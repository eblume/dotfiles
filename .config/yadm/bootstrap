### TO USE: `yadm bootstrap` - fully idempotent and intended to be run often to get upgrades, etc.
# To bootstrap from 0, you must first install yadm.
# https://yadm.io/docs/install
# On Mac OS, the typical process is:
#  1. /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#  2. brew install yadm
#  3. yadm clone <DOTFILES REPO HERE>
#  4. yadm bootstrap
#
# (on non-Mac OS, you just need to replace steps 1 and 2 with whatever gives you a working 'yadm'.)

# But before we do anything, let's check to see if we're up to date.
# We will check the rev-parse of local and remote and if they don't match we will pull and then re-exec.
yadm fetch

    yadm pull

    echo "I suggest running 'yadm push' to avoid forking history."
    echo "Sleeping for 10s so you can think about it."
    echo "(Feel free to ctrl+c and run it now!)"

    echo "OK here we go..."

### Set up iterm2 config

### Install mise versions (mise provided via homebrew/nix-darwin)
if
    ! command -v mise >/dev/null

# (This is also run every time an interactive prompt loads)
eval "$(mise hook-env -s zsh)"

# Regenerate poetry completions (because mise may have changed)
poetry completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_poetry

### Bootstrap sumbodules
# (at time of writing, not used, but could be used some day and shouldn't hurt?)
yadm submodule update --recursive --init

### Bootstrap neovim packer.nvim
# (This will fail if packer hasn't yet bootstrqpped; in which case, just run 'nvim' once and then bootstrap again)
nvim --headless -c 'autocmd User PackerComplete quitall' -c 'PackerSync'

### Install global python packages
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pynvim  # see :help provider-python -- and no it can't be pipx

### Install llm plugins
llm install llm-gpt4all
llm install llama-cpp-python
llm install llm-llama-cpp
# See model installation instructions here:
# https://github.com/simonw/llm-llama-cpp#adding-models

### Provision nb-cli with my notebook sync repo

### Update remote url to use git now that we know ssh is in place

if [ "$remote_url"  != "$intended_url" ]; then

### FIN
