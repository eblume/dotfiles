### TO USE: `yadm bootstrap` - fully idempotent and intended to be run often to get upgrades, etc.
# To bootstrap from 0, you must first install yadm.
# https://yadm.io/docs/install
# On Mac OS, the typical process is:
#  1. /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#  2. brew install yadm
#  3. yadm clone <DOTFILES REPO HERE>
#  4. yadm bootstrap
#
# (on non-Mac OS, you just need to replace steps 1 and 2 with whatever gives you a working 'yadm'.)

# But before we do anything, let's check to see if we're up to date.
# We will check the rev-parse of local and remote and if they don't match we will pull and then re-exec.
yadm fetch

### Install Nix

### Nix-Darwin flake activation

### Install mise versions (mise provided via homebrew/nix-darwin)
if

then

# (This is also run every time an interactive prompt loads)
eval "$(mise hook-env -s zsh)"

# Regenerate poetry completions (because mise may have changed)
poetry completions zsh > ~/.zfunc/_poetry

### Bootstrap sumbodules
# (at time of writing, not used, but could be used some day and shouldn't hurt?)
yadm submodule update --recursive --init

### Bootstrap neovim packer.nvim
# (This will fail if packer hasn't yet bootstrqpped; in which case, just run 'nvim' once and then bootstrap again)
nvim --headless -c 'autocmd User PackerComplete quitall' -c 'PackerSync'

### Install global python packages
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pynvim  # see :help provider-python -- and no it can't be pipx

### Install llm plugins
llm install llm-gpt4all
llm install llama-cpp-python
llm install llm-llama-cpp
# See model installation instructions here:
# https://github.com/simonw/llm-llama-cpp#adding-models

### Provision aws-vault

# setup_aws_vault
# This has been disabled because it keeps locking my screen on a password prompt, despite the empty password. I suspect
# the issue is that the first time create-keychain is run it prompts for a password anyway, and I naively type in my
# usual password and then that overrides the otherwise empty password. Or maybe it's something else, but the point is
# that I'm not using aws-vault actively right now and I don't want to deal with this. I'll re-enable it if I start
# running in to issues.

### Provision nb-cli with my notebook sync repo
if 
    ! command -v nb >/dev/null

### Update remote url to use git now that we know ssh is in place

### FIN

# still reading?
# Putting this here makes me a bit happier every time I run bootstrap, and also if it fails then something went wrong
# yaaay
